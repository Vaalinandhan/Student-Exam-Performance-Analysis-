## 🎯 Project Objectives / Questions Explored
- 🔹 Are there significant score differences between **genders** across subjects?  
- 🔹 Does **parental education level** correlate with student performance?  
- 🔹 Which subject has the **highest average score** overall? Which is the most variable?  
- 🔹 How does **lunch type** or **test preparation** affect student performance?  
- 🔹 Is there evidence of **bias or disparity** in performance across demographic groups?

---

## 🛠️ Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Rename confusing column headers for clarity.  
- Check and fix **missing or inconsistent values**.  
- Convert **categorical/text features** into analyzable formats.

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib 
- Create **6–8 well-chosen visuals** to compare, contrast, and interpret trends.  
- Graph types may include count plots, histograms, box plots, and pair plots.

### 3️⃣ Insight Generation
- Highlight **comparisons or disparities** among student groups.  
- Comment on **correlations or associations** between variables.  
- Optionally apply **statistical tests** (T-test, Chi-square) to validate insights.

### 4️⃣ Optional Enhancements
- 🔹 Use **SQL** for summarizing or filtering raw data.  
- 🔹 Create a **correlation matrix** and interpret relationships.  
- 🔹 Design an **interactive dashboard** to visualize insights.

## Key Insights from Student Performance Analysis

This analysis, based on a dataset of 1,000 student exam records, provides initial findings on academic performance.

### Top 6 Preliminary Insights

1.  **Lowest Performance in Math:** Students show the lowest average score in Math (mean $\approx 66.09$), while performing best in Reading (mean $\approx 69.17$).
2.  **Complete and Clean Dataset:** The source data is highly reliable, consisting of **1,000 entries** with **no missing values** across all 8 features (5 categorical, 3 numerical).
3.  **Near-Normal Score Distribution:** Scores in all subjects closely follow a normal distribution, with a slight **negative skew**, indicating the majority of scores cluster towards the higher end of the scale.
4.  **Highest Variability in Writing:** The **Writing score** (Standard Deviation $\approx 15.20$) shows the greatest spread in performance among students, closely followed by Math ($\approx 15.16$).
5.  **Presence of Extreme Low Scores:** The data includes records of students with significantly low scores, such as a **Math score of 0** and a **Writing score of 10**.
6.  **Symmetrical Distribution Confirmed:** The mean and median scores are closely aligned across all three subjects, confirming the overall symmetry of the score distributions.
